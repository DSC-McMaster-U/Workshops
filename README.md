# Workshops & Talks
Resources and code for Technical Workshops & Talks hosted by DSC McMaster.

## Purpose 
- To create ever-growing resources and documentation for the workshops & talks we do.
- To embrace open source culture and allow the team to get involved in helping develop workshop content and curriculum. 
- Allow people to contribute to Workshops & Talks without the need of necessarily hosting one. 
- Help teach students industry software development workflows by getting used to GitHub and contributing

## Contributing
Workshop & Talks team members will be the main contributors to this repository. Once you are part of the team that is working on a particular workshop, the hosts of the workshops will work their team to develop the content for the workshop/talk. Members will take on GitHub issues and submit pull requests against what they are assigned.

## Guidlines
- Each workshop/talk should have a seperate folder created with a `README` inside to serve as a guide for that topic. 
  - See [Creating an Effective GitHub profile](https://github.com/DSC-McMaster-U/Workshops/tree/main/Creating%20an%20Effective%20GitHub%20Profile) folder as an Example
- Guides can be split into seperate `README` files in subfolders if it makes sense or if the workshop if part of a series
